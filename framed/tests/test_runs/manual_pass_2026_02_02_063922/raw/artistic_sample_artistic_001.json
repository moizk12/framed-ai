  "critique": "I see a vertical plane wholly cloaked \u2014 a wall turned altar by moss and lichen, a single continuous field that refuses to let the structure beneath speak. The growth is not a laughable smear of neglect but a deliberate veil: uniform, persistent, intimate with the surface but never fused to it. Weathering is present as a whisper at the edges, a softened seam, not the headline; the story is the coating itself.\n\nYou have resolved something here you used to struggle with: the impulse to repair has been traded for the discipline to let occupation read as subject. Where I once read a problem-image \u2014 a thing to be cleaned, mended, restored \u2014 I now see an aftermath-image: the coating as consecration, time as an artist that covers rather than destroys. That shift matters. It changes the work from testimony of failure to testimony of becoming.\n\nThere is a quiet reverence and, beneath it, a slight unease. The non-integration \u2014 the fact that the growth remains a surface veil and not a porous fusion \u2014 keeps the composition in a productive tension. It feels like a thin skin laid over memory: present and separable, beautiful and removable. This is not decay made picturesque; it is occupation insisting on its terms.\n\nYou keep circling the question of identity: what lies under the green? Stone? Painted brick? Concrete? Do you want the viewer to sense that hidden substrate or to be gently made to forget it? Your choices here will set the moral tone: neglect, ecology, ritual. A title will tip the register. A tighter crop will consecrate the field; an edge retained will keep the dialectic of veil versus support alive.\n\nI offer two small challenges. Make one version that commits fully \u2014 eliminate every structural cue until the image is a pure field, an almost religious surface. Make a second version that reveals a sliver of edge or hinge, enough to keep the tension between coating and thing coated; let that hinge carry a narrative charge. Decide, too, whether your palette should emphasize unity \u2014 a ritual monochrome \u2014 or magnify the micro-variations that testify to time\u2019s passage.\n\nI used to read this work through the narrow lens of restoration; looking now, I see you practicing a different patience. Let that change be intentional, not accidental. You have consecrated a surface; will you now consecrate the choice to hide or to hint?",
