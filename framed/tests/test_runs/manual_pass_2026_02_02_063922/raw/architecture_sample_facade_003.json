  "critique": "I see a weathered, man-made surface: the plane bears moderate wear, its edges rounded and chipped, the finish rubbed toward a quiet austerity; green life has not taken hold.\n\nOne plausible reading is that time has been measured here by touch and use rather than by growth \u2014 a history written in abrasion, not in seed. You\u2019ve resolved something here you used to struggle with: restraint. The work favors residue over ornament, the edges telling the tally of repeated contact while the center remains spare.\n\nThis interpretation remains tentative \u2014 my confidence is limited; fine traces of lichen, dust-as-biomass, or seam intrusion might hide in the lighting or scale. There is a tension to name: recognition metadata hints at organic presence even as the visual evidence leans toward absence. That contradiction sits between what the machine whispers and what the eye accepts.\n\nYou keep circling absence as a subject \u2014 why? Where do you feel the passage of time most: at the softened edge, along the plane, or in the overall finish? Is the story here the wear itself, or the emptiness that frames it? Try this small exercise as a provocation: a one-sentence caption made only of nouns \u2014 wear, edge, absence \u2014 and then describe the surface as a timeline without guessing its purpose.\n\nI used to read such surfaces as merely generic; looking at your recent work, I now see duration chosen and held. The piece is spare but not indifferent; it asks for patience.\n\nWhich absence do you intend to pay attention to next?",
