  "critique": "I see weathered stone, its face cloaked in a single, unwavering green skin. The living veil lies on the surface like enamel\u2014moss, lichen, algae\u2014less a tangle than a continuous coat that both softens and reveals the masonry beneath.\n\nYou have resolved something here you used to struggle with: the impulse to correct has given way to the discipline of witness. Where once I would have read this as a maintenance problem, I now read it as a record of duration \u2014 two timescales in conversation. The biological skin moves quickly enough to paint the plane uniform; the mineral beneath erodes more slowly, its edges fraying like the soft punctuation of time.\n\nA few particulars anchor the image. The growth insists on flatness rather than invasion; the wall remains legible as architecture first, ecology second \u2014 layered, not fused. Edge degradation is a secondary voice, a quieter register that, if listened to, tells of seasons and runoff, of shade and patience.\n\nYou keep circling a few themes \u2014 residue, duration, the dignity of decay. Why do you want the viewer to read first the built stone or the living patina? Is this a picture of abandonment, of endurance, or of an uneasy symbiosis between climate and craft? Will you flatten the frame to make a study of surface-time, or will you open it outward to locate the wall in a human world?\n\nA challenge: make one decisive choice in how you see this \u2014 front-on, flat light to insist on the continuity of the skin; or raking, oblique light to let the slow erosion show its hand. Consider a diptych: one image for the total coverage, one for the boundary where stone and green negotiate.\n\nI used to treat such scenes as problems to be solved; looking at your work now, I see patience, a trust in what accumulates. Which truth will you make the first voice in the frame?",
