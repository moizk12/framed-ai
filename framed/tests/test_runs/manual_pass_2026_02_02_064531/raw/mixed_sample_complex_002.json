  "critique": "I see weathered stone, a vertical face wholly veiled by living green \u2014 a continuous skin of moss and lichen whose soft insistence maps the passage of moisture and light. The edges of the surface have been eaten back; erosion reads not as an accident but as a frame, a deliberate border that sets the veil in relief.\n\nYou have composed duration. Where once I would have cataloged faults and prescribed fixes, you now allow the image to speak as record: time\u2019s hand has written patiently across a substrate and left its handwriting intact. The growth here is surface-skin, not a takeover of structure; that fact makes the work less about conquest and more about inscription. The wall is not a ruin crying for repair but a ledger that records seasons, weather, and a slow, steady fidelity to place.\n\nYou\u2019ve resolved something you used to struggle with \u2014 the urge to correct has softened into the courage to witness. This is the photograph of a patience, and its melancholy is modest: respect, not despair. Yet tension remains. The image flirts with familiar narratives \u2014 \u201cnature reclaims\u201d or \u201cdecay\u201d \u2014 and at the same time refuses them, because the organisms sit lightly, forming a veil rather than an obliteration. Which story do you want the viewer to read?\n\nA few questions press against the quiet: do you prefer to call this \u201ctime writing a skin\u201d or to resist both reclaiming and decay as tropes? Where is the threshold you want us to anchor on \u2014 the softened edge that reads like horizon, a seam, or a shift in texture? Is this meant as place \u2014 a specific wall with a life \u2014 or as an abstract field of time?\n\nOne challenge: make a single curatorial sentence that describes the relation between wall, time, and growth without naming ruin, decay, or reclamation. Another: is the decision to leave the edges visible a framing choice or an unresolved habit from earlier work that sought repair?\n\nYou have turned a maintenance report into a durational portrait. What will you ask of the next frame: to isolate that eroded edge as a horizon, or to let the veil become infinite?",
