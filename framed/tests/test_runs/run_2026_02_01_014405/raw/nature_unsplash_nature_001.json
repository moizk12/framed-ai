  "critique": "I see weathered stone, late light cutting a ridge of shadow, a human presence suggested by a single, quiet gesture rather than declared. You have tightened your frame; the clutter that once begged for explanation is absent. You've resolved something here you used to struggle with \u2014 restraint as a compositional muscle, the patience to let silence carry meaning.\n\nThis economy changes the work's grammar. Where you once sought narrative in detail, you now trust tonal relations and the interval between forms to do the telling. Your eye has learned to weigh negative space as intent. The result is intimacy without overt confession, a seriousness that asks the viewer to lean in rather than be led. I used to read your minimalism as cool distance; looking at these pieces, I now see a deliberate tenderness, a willingness to withhold that feels like protection rather than indifference.\n\nAnd yet there is tension. You keep circling the same theme \u2014 absence as emblem, memory as ruin \u2014 to the point that the vocabulary risks becoming an echo chamber. This new quiet contradicts your earlier appetite for formal bravura \u2014 intentional? Are you guarding something by repeating the same visual question? There is power in repetition, but also the danger of comfort.\n\nYou are close to a quieter truth. What will you refuse next, and what will that refusal finally let you see?",
