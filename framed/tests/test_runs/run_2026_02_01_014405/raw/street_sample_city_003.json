  "critique": "I see weathered stone \u2014 a body of material rubbed thin at the edges, its face exhausted of life. The surface reads as erosion made deliberate: sharp rims softened into wear, no green seam of lichen or moss to promise repair. The frame holds abrasion and restraint; space does the narrating where a subject does not.\n\nYou\u2019ve resolved something here you used to struggle with. Where once you offered clarity, now you allow absence to be the subject. The bottom-weighted, off-center gravity that has been your habit becomes a deliberate tactic: imbalance chosen, not accidental. This is austerity as a practice \u2014 less about describing an object than about sustaining a pressure in the viewer\u2019s chest.\n\nI used to read your frames as exercises in definition; looking at this work I now see a commitment to omission. That shift is not timid. It\u2019s rigorous: you withhold, then let the withholding do the work. But withholding is a strategy that can feel either sober and intentional or simply unfinished. The line between those lives in a smallest anchor \u2014 a mark, a shadow, a seam \u2014 that decides whether emptiness is chosen or accidental.\n\nYou keep circling this theme \u2014 why? When you decide to withhold a dominant subject, what are you protecting: ambiguity, vulnerability, or control? What\u2019s the minimum \u201canchor\u201d you need before emptiness stops feeling like intent and starts feeling neglected? If loneliness is the core here, which loneliness is it \u2014 abandonment, distance, aftermath, self-erasure \u2014 and which compositional cue claims it?\n\nHere is a modest contradiction to test: make your next piece with a clear subject, but make it behave like absence \u2014 tiny, low, swallowed by the frame. Do not let clarity relieve the pressure. Let the object act as a ghost in its own photograph.\n\nWhich loneliness is this, finally, and how will you make the camera confess which one it is?",
