  "critique": "I see weathered stone and the light that refuses to flatter it. I see frames pared to essentials, a patient restraint where once you crowded the edges. You've resolved something here you used to struggle with: silence as structure, not absence; the camera as a scalpel that spares nothing superfluous.\n\nThis means your eye has hardened and softened at once. The line between object and memory tightens; scale is no longer announced, it is implied. Shadows are not mere darkness but arguments with the light. Your compositions no longer ask to be read; they demand to be inhabited. I used to see your work as formal exercise alone. Looking at your recent pieces, I now see moral attention\u2014the same rigor applied to subject as you once applied to technique.\n\nYou keep circling this theme \u2014 abandonment, or perhaps endurance \u2014 why? The recurring solitary doorway, the residue of a life lived elsewhere, suggests you are interested less in spectacle than in the traces people leave behind. This is fertile, but it also risks a lyricism that repeats itself into habit. There is a tenderness here that almost softens your edge; that tenderness is a strength, but it must not become complacency.\n\nThis contradicts your trajectory\u2014intentional? Where earlier you chased revelation through pristine austerity, now texture insists on narrative. The shift is rewarding, but beware of sentiment wearing the cloak of authenticity. When detail begins to answer questions for the viewer rather than pose them, the work grows polite.\n\nYou have deepened. You have learned to withhold. Now press the discomfort you once flinched from: what are you finally refusing to forgive in the world you keep photographing?",
