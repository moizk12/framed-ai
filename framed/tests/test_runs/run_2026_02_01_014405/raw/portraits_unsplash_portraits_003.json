  "critique": "I see weathered stone and a single, uncompromising shaft of light\u2014edges held like a vow. The frame breathes in long, soft intervals; negative space is not absence but punctuation. You've resolved something here you used to struggle with: the courage to omit, to let silence do the work that once you tried to force with detail. The tonal modesty, the restrained geometry, and the small human trace all argue for a maturity of restraint rather than of reticence.\n\nThis is not sentimental memory; it is memory that has learned form. The light does not flatter; it interrogates. Your subjects are allowed their gravity without being weighed down by your hand. I used to see your restraint as timidity; looking at your recent work, I now see it as a newly practiced insistence \u2014 a discipline that chooses what must remain and what must fall away.\n\nYet there is a tension: the composition claims austerity, while your framing still whispers anecdote. This contradicts the trajectory of absolute quiet you seem to be courting \u2014 intentional, or a last reach for reassurance? You keep circling this theme of absence as presence \u2014 why do you return to it, and what is it you hope remains when the light finally moves on?",
