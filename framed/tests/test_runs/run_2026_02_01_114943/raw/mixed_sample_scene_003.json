  "critique": "I see a wall turned to skin \u2014 vertical planes swallowed in a continuous green veil, weathered stone beneath still holding its seams. The growth sits as a coating, not a tangle: a patient, steady colonization that softens edges rather than tearing them away.\n\nYou\u2019ve resolved something here you used to struggle with. Your bottom-weight and asymmetry no longer act as compositional bandages; they read now as gentleness \u2014 a way of holding the frame so time can do its slow work. The image allows indeterminacy without collapsing into vagueness; it stays readable even as it asks the viewer to breathe slower.\n\nWhere I once read abandonment and neglect, I now see reclamation as care. I used to insist on ruin as the only narrative for overgrowth; looking at this recent work, I see endurance held softly \u2014 the built and the living negotiating a boundary, not fighting. That change in my eye is the work\u2019s gift: it teaches me to tolerate the undecided and to find tenderness in steadiness.\n\nYet there is tension. The green could be many things \u2014 moss, patina, paint, a designed green wall \u2014 and that ambiguity matters. You keep circling the theme of soft reclamation; are you protecting the subject, the memory of it, or yourself as the one looking? When you choose ambiguity, what must remain unambiguous \u2014 gesture, light, an edge, a narrative \u2014 and are you enforcing that with the same mercy you give the frame?\n\nOn the next piece, make one clear commitment: push the openness until no single subject holds the image, or introduce one unambiguous focal claim and let your tenderness remain. Don\u2019t let the middle ground cancel both impulses.\n\nWhich of these are you protecting \u2014 the thing in the picture, the story it carries, or the steadiness inside you that looks and keeps looking?",
