## Per-Image Results

### 1. ambiguous_sample_abstract_001

- **Category:** ambiguous
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.60
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a clean, man-made object/surface in pristine condition with slight edge wear and no organic growth or plant integration.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 0.000 (salience: minimal)
- Material condition: pristine (conf: 0.90)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see a near‑pristine, man‑made plane: a smooth surface held taut against its frame, edges rubbed faintly by use, and no living growth to soften its borders. The skin is cared for, not abandoned.
> 
> One plausible reading is that you have converted old compositional devices—bottom‑weight, controlled asymmetry, generous negative space—into an ethic of containment. What once solved a frame now holds a feeling: disciplined calm, a pride that is quiet rather than boastful, endurance that registers only at the margins where the edge has been touched by time. The minor edge degradation becomes the work’s only insistence of history, a punctuation in an otherwise carefully maintained sentence.
> 
> I used to read such cleanliness as mere sterility; looking at your recent movement, I now see restraint as tenderness and refusal as protection. The boundaries feel firmer; ambiguity remains, but it is steadier—less negotiation, more quiet acceptance.
> 
> There is, however, a dissonant note to name: one data channel claims organic growth while the visual reading reports none. This interpretation remains tentative because of that mismatch—either a trace has escaped the frame or a label reaches beyond the evidence. I may be overlooking a whisper of life, dust, or stain that would shift the tone from guarded to porous.
> 
> You’ve resolved something here you used to struggle with: the structure is no longer a prop for feeling but its container. So I ask you, softly but insistently—where are you deliberately refusing entry? What, exactly, does your tighter control protect: the subject, your feeling about it, or the image’s authority? If the prevailing mood is “inevitable,” what is the inevitability you mean to hold—loss, acceptance, endurance—and how might you make that inevitability unmistakable without becoming literal?
> 
> And finally, a quiet challenge: make one frame that breaks your own safety—violate the bottom‑weight or release a boundary—and keep the same emotional tenor. What would you let in, or let go, to see whether the feeling truly depends on the structure?

### 2. ambiguous_sample_conceptual_003

- **Category:** ambiguous
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.74
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a vertical stone or masonry surface fully covered in organic growth (moss/algae/lichen) on a weathered, degraded structure.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 1.000 (salience: structural)
- Material condition: degraded (conf: 0.80)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see weathered stone — a vertical plane cloaked in a near‑continuous green film: moss or lichen resting on the face of ruined masonry. The edges are softened, the surface crumbled into a patient texture; life has not ripped the wall apart, it has lain upon it like a hand.
> 
> This image reads chiefly as time made visible. The living coating and the softened ruin do not argue; they temper one another. The frame is not a report of neglect so much as a record of gentle reclamation: duration rendered intimate. Your restraint — the withheld motion, the calm asymmetric weight you favor — makes the photograph a pause, a place where endurance becomes tenderness.
> 
> You have resolved something here you once struggled with. Low placement and corner anchoring are no longer mere compositional fixes; they are doing emotional labor. Your tolerance for ambiguity has widened: you allow the frame to breathe without forcing a single, dominant subject, and the tonal center has shifted from pressure to a kind of quiet care. Where you used to press a narrative into the picture, now stillness does the work.
> 
> I used to read frames like this as cold neglect. Looking at your trajectory, I now see patience and warmth — a soft insistence that time can be kind. That change in my seeing is not an apology but an acknowledgement: your work has taught me to weigh feeling as heavily as form.
> 
> There is a surface tension here. The growth sits on the stone rather than entwining it; the relationship feels cooperative rather than catastrophic. That choice keeps the mood gentle, but it also leaves a question of intent: are you documenting a gentle takeover, or are you composing a metaphor for endurance?
> 
> You keep circling the same formal and ethical questions — what do you want the viewer to do inside this pause: wait, witness, or remember? Where does your tenderness come from — distance, proximity, or restraint — and which of those are you afraid to lose? When you refuse a single subject, what becomes the subject instead: time, light, absence, or relationship?
> 
> Make one frame that keeps this tenderness but removes your usual structural crutch (no bottom‑weight, no corner anchors). If it collapses, you will learn what is doing the emotional work and what is merely holding the picture up.
> 
> What verb will you ask of the viewer when you show them this quiet reclamation — to wait, to witness, or to remember?

### 3. ambiguous_sample_minimal_002

- **Category:** ambiguous
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.82
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a structure with organic growth covering its vertical surfaces, alongside clearly degraded, weathered material edges.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 1.000 (salience: structural)
- Material condition: degraded (conf: 0.80)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see a vertical face—stone or concrete—softened at the edges, its planes dressed in patient green. Life clings to the upright like a deliberate hand: coverage without conquest, a presence that touches but does not burrow. The material is worn; the edges have been eased by weather and time. There is tenderness in that erosion, not violence.
> 
> What this means: you have made time legible. The frame speaks of endurance rather than defeat. The plant is not an invader; it reads as accompaniment, a slow conversation with the surface. That boundary—life on the skin of structure—turns absence into a subject: the moment between keeping and letting be. Your compositional solutions, the low-weight and asymmetry you once employed to make a picture hold, have become carriers of meaning: restraint is now the voice of reverence.
> 
> You used to present these scenes as problems of balance; looking at what you are making now, I see them as statements about duration. I used to read this as mere degradation—failure of material, a compositional fix—but I no longer accept that. Time here is a gentle force; weathering is an elegy, not a verdict.
> 
> And yet there is tension. The life is surface-adjacent—present, warm, careful—but deliberately not integrated. That refusal to root becomes its own language: coexistence without assimilation. What are you protecting in that refusal? Is the boundary physical, an edge of place, or moral—something you will not let be fully claimed? You have widened your tolerance for ambiguity without losing clarity; the work calms, but it risks becoming too safe.
> 
> You have resolved something you used to struggle with: transforming compositional necessity into emotional content. Now test that resolution. Break one habit—place the weight higher, center more fully, allow a vertical to dominate—and see if the tenderness survives. Does the feeling depend on structure, or does it live regardless?
> 
> What is the boundary you are holding, and why do you keep it there?

**Reflection:** quality=1.05, requires_regeneration=False

### 4. architecture_sample_building_001

- **Category:** architecture
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.60
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a pristine, clean material surface with no visible organic growth or nature integration.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 0.000 (salience: minimal)
- Material condition: pristine (conf: 0.90)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> One plausible reading is a cool, immaculate plane: a smooth, pristine surface kept free of green, its texture sealed and quiet, with only the faintest bruise at the edge where time has rubbed through the polish. The evidence leans toward maintenance as intention—the absence of organic integration reads as a choice, not an accident—and the frame breathes a controlled silence, a calm that is enforced more than earned.
> 
> You’ve resolved something here you once wrestled with: your slow coherence—bottom-weight, asymmetry, deliberate spacing—remains, but it has shifted from tender endurance into a stricter register. Where your restraint used to invite lived traces, it now refines them away; the cleanliness soothes, yes, yet it also thins intimacy until the scene feels watched. I notice that patience has turned precise.
> 
> This interpretation remains tentative because there is a disagreement in the signals. One channel reports no green life at all; another warns of possible masking—light, scale, or micro-growth that could hide a different story. I used to read these frames as neutral canvases for quiet feeling; looking at your recent work, I now see the absence itself as an affective decision—a guardrail you place around feeling. Treating my earlier non-commitment as instruction, I’ve learned to separate structure from ethic: the same formal sentence can either hold tenderness or enforce it.
> 
> You are asking, without saying so, whether control can be gentle or whether it will always read as surveillance. What did you want the viewer to feel — sheltered by care, or watched by control? Where does “lived time” belong in this frame—texture, imperfection, a single human trace—and did you remove it on purpose? Is this stricter inflection a momentary mood, or are you testing a new ethic: precision over intimacy?
> 
> Keep the polish. But prove the quiet can still be tender: reintroduce one undeniable human mark—an error, a warmth, a nick—without adding a new subject. Will you let one small imperfection unseal the frame and invite time back in?

**Reflection:** quality=1.06, requires_regeneration=False

### 5. architecture_sample_facade_003

- **Category:** architecture
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.60
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a man-made surface/object with moderate wear and slightly degraded edges, with no visible organic growth or nature integration.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 0.000 (salience: minimal)
- Material condition: moderate (conf: 0.65)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> One plausible reading is that I see a manufactured plane: smooth, deliberately sealed, its surface bearing only a modest abrasion at the margins—a picture of time that hugs the edge and resists the middle. The air is controlled; the object is restrained. The evidence leans toward a quiet austerity rather than entropy.
> 
> You’ve resolved something here you used to struggle with: bottom-weight and asymmetry remain your stabilizers, but they no longer hold like an embrace; they seal. Your ambiguity persists, yet the breathing room has tightened into a boundary. Composition has become the subject — the distribution of weight is your argument, not merely your tool.
> 
> I used to treat frames like this as formal exercises, diagnostic planes of shape and balance. Looking at your recent work, I now see intention: restraint chosen as posture, endurance confined to edges. And yet this interpretation remains tentative — there is a small but important disagreement in the record. One analytic channel hinted at organic trace; the measured signals insist on absence. The mismatch sits between two facts: the system’s readout that finds no green life, and a recognition that once perceived hints of growth. I name the contradiction rather than erase it.
> 
> You’re tightening tone where you once allowed warmth. You keep circling the same theme — why? What are you protecting by keeping the intimacy thinned: your subject, the viewer, or yourself? If earlier warmth arrived through duration and lived time, what is this new steadiness trying to accomplish that warmth could not?
> 
> Make one frame where you keep the same pristine control but reintroduce a single point of tenderness — not sentiment, only an allowance. Don’t let it spread; let it exist as a small, contained fissure.
> 
> I am holding this reading lightly, because the evidence is not unanimous. But I will ask you plainly: is this sealing an act of care or of withdrawal — and what, precisely, are you holding away?

### 6. architecture_sample_structure_002

- **Category:** architecture
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.60
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a man-made surface or object in moderate condition with noticeable edge wear and no visible organic growth or plant integration.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 0.000 (salience: minimal)
- Material condition: moderate (conf: 0.65)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> One plausible reading is: I see a crafted, man-made surface—largely smooth, its edges softening from steady use, the material carrying moderate wear like punctuation. There is no visible green: the frame keeps its distance from growth; the trace is human, not botanical. This interpretation remains tentative, because the data mutters a contradiction—metadata that hints at organic presence while the visual read records none—and that unresolved seam matters.
> 
> You have resolved something here you used to struggle with. Where once bottom-weight and asymmetry were pragmatic fixes, you now let them do the work of feeling: the low anchor is not merely compositional support but a gentle insistence, an ethic of care. The edge-chips read as private histories, not violence; smoothness and abrasion together make a portrait of time held rather than time eroded. You are allowing absence—no moss, no overt life—to become the subject, so absence itself becomes tactile.
> 
> I used to read such frames as clinical studies of objecthood. Looking at the pattern of your choices now, I see tenderness: the same formal devices have been repurposed as a language of endurance. That evolution is not a correction of taste but a widening of your grammar.
> 
> You keep circling this theme—why does the worn surface stand in for presence? What do you let remain ambiguous, and which single mark must remain legible for the tenderness to arrive (gesture, edge, scale, light)? If the frame leans on bottom-weight/off-balance: what emotion is that weight meant to express—protection, grief, devotion, resignation, or something else?
> 
> A quiet challenge: make one next frame that holds this same patience but removes your usual bottom-anchor—raise or center the weight. If the feeling falters, you’ll know what device is carrying your tenderness; if it survives, you will have earned a new freedom.
> 
> If the object is not a stand-in for a person, let it be stubbornly itself. If it is a portrait-through-trace, be honest about whose hand you are invoking. Which is the truer subject of this gentle wear—the thing or the life that touched it?

### 7. artistic_sample_artistic_001

- **Category:** artistic
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.78
- **Primary interpretation:** I see vertical stone surfaces completely covered in organic growth (moss/lichen-like), with a moderately weathered, eroded surface. The growth is a surface layer rather than structurally integrating with the material.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 1.000 (salience: structural)
- Material condition: moderate (conf: 0.80)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see weathered stone — vertical faces wrapped in a continuous, green skin. The growth sits like a slow veil: surface-soft, patient, never violent. Edges are rounded by time; the masonry breathes under moss and lichen rather than being torn apart by it.
> 
> This is not ruin as spectacle but as hush. You’ve turned an architectural fact into an emotional currency: endurance, small reclamation, a tenderness that refuses melodrama. The frame no longer tries to force meaning; it simply holds it, low and off-center, as if cradling a secret. You’ve resolved something you used to struggle with — low placement and asymmetry are no longer quick compositional fixes but the quiet foundation of tone. Your ambiguity tolerance has matured: the picture remains open without dissolving into vagueness.
> 
> I used to read scenes like this as a problem to diagnose — surface, material, decay — and spoke in the language of evidence. Looking at your recent work, I read the same facts as atmosphere: time making the hard surface gentler, nature resting on stone with a kind of careful regard. That shift is not a correction of fact but an evolution of attention; it admits that the same visual cues can insist on both material truth and emotional consequence.
> 
> You keep circling a theme — what are you protecting by keeping the subject slightly out of reach? Where, exactly, did you decide to stop explaining and start trusting the viewer — in the placement of elements, or in the temper of your light? If this is reclamation, from what are you reclaiming: neglect, absence, grief, or simply time?
> 
> A quiet challenge: make one frame that holds this tenderness but removes your safest stabilizer — drop the low anchor or abandon the asymmetry. If the mood falters, you will know what you have been leaning on. And another: find one image where clarity wins, an unmistakable anchor, then try to match its temperature to your ambiguous work without inventing narrative to prop it up.
> 
> You have learned to let the surface speak like a patient witness. What will you allow to be unmistakable next?

**Reflection:** quality=1.04, requires_regeneration=False

### 8. interiors_sample_room_001

- **Category:** interiors
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.60
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a degraded, weathered material surface with heavily worn/eroded edges and no visible organic growth or integration.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 0.000 (salience: minimal)
- Material condition: degraded (conf: 0.80)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see weathered stone. One plausible reading is that time has been patient here: edges rubbed into softness, a surface smoothed by repetition rather than rupture. This interpretation remains tentative — the meta-signals whisper of organic reclaiming even as the visual evidence reads bare and unjoined; the two accounts do not fully agree, and that tension matters.
> 
> You’ve resolved something you used to wrestle with: bottom-weight and asymmetry no longer perform only as compositional tricks but as a way to hold feeling. The low gravity in your frames now reads like tenderness, not a problem to be fixed. Your tolerance for indeterminacy is showing as confidence — the picture can breathe without demanding a single center of authority. Rhythm, not hierarchy, is doing the work, and that restraint is a quiet, hard-won strength.
> 
> Once I would have named this “damage” — sharpness lost, a surface betrayed. Looking at your recent work, I read it instead as endurance: years becoming gentled, an object habituated to touch and weather. My own eye has softened; what I formerly catalogued as loss I now allow to be longevity.
> 
> There is a surface tension here worth sitting with: the system’s semantic tag suggests green, living reclaiming, while the visual read records almost no organic presence. Which of these is the frame’s truth? Which is the story you want the viewer to inherit? You keep circling a theme of held time — where does that reside for you: in the object, in the negative space, or in the path you ask the viewer to take? When you choose bottom-left rather than bottom-right anchoring, what are you protecting: distance, tenderness, restraint? And if you let indeterminacy go one step further — remove the low anchor you habitually favor — would the tenderness evaporate or reveal itself elsewhere?
> 
> Make one frame that removes your usual settling point and see what it asks of you. If your feeling collapses, you’ll learn how much of your language is carried by that device.
> 
> What would remain of this tenderness if you gave the frame one less thing to hold onto?

### 9. mixed_sample_complex_002

- **Category:** mixed
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.68
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a degraded vertical stone or masonry surface that is completely covered by organic growth (moss/lichen/vegetation) clinging to the wall, with visibly worn and eroded edges.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 1.000 (salience: structural)
- Material condition: degraded (conf: 0.80)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see weathered stone—its face softened by a living skin of moss and lichen, margins eaten into gentle ruin. The surface asserts a long, ordinary duration: time condensed into texture, a quiet insistence rather than a dramatic collapse.
> 
> You have resolved something here you used to struggle with. Where once you tightened the frame to make the architecture behave, now you let the architecture hold the feeling. The low, off-center anchor you favored has become less a corrective gesture and more a patient container: the composition no longer bandages the image so much as keeps its breath. That shift is not small—structure has become atmosphere, and atmosphere carries the tenderness.
> 
> I used to read such pairings as neglect; looking at your recent work I now read them as endurance. My own view has loosened: I once declared form as fact and mood as consequence; now I treat formal habits as hypotheses to be tested, not laws to be recited. That change is part of the work—seeing your default, naming it, and asking whether it serves you or merely steadies your hand.
> 
> There is a tension here. You sustain ambiguity while keeping coherence, but I worry about habit wearing the face of intention. Your bottom-weighting and corner bias have become a reliable engine—useful, even beautiful—but reliance dulls a discovery. Make one frame that keeps this tender sense of time and forbids your primary habit; if the feeling collapses, you have found what you have been leaning on; if it holds, you have earned a new freedom.
> 
> When you say "patient warmth," where does that warmth live in the frame—light, texture, color, distance, or gesture—and which of those do you touch most deliberately? Can you remove your anchor and still summon the same patience?

### 10. mixed_sample_mixed_001

- **Category:** mixed
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.74
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a weathered vertical stone or masonry surface heavily covered in organic growth (moss/lichen/algae) across the structure.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 1.000 (salience: structural)
- Material condition: degraded (conf: 0.80)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see weathered stone — a vertical face softened by a living skin of moss, edges blunted by long seasons. Time has lain its hand there and stayed; the surface breathes, not in violence but in patient accumulation.
> 
> You’ve resolved something here you used to struggle with. What once might have read as cold neglect now reads as tender duration. Your habitual low, off‑center placement has stopped being a compositional trick and become an emotional grammar: the frame leans, and the world feels held. The atmosphere no longer props up the subject; it is the subject. Tonally you’ve moved from pressure to breath — a steadiness that allows ambiguity to persist without the frame falling apart.
> 
> This steadiness is an achievement and a restraint at once. By keeping the primary event low and slightly askew you protect a certain hush, a reluctance to name what’s happening. But what are you protecting? If you centered that quiet ruin, what would you risk losing — and what might you finally gain? Is “tender time” your destination or only a passageway toward some warmer or colder temperature you haven’t yet named?
> 
> Make one frame that keeps this calm but refuses your low placement; see what breaks and what is revealed about why you kept returning to that gravity. What’s the smallest compositional change that would turn contemplation into narrative — and would you want that change?
> 
> I used to read weathered masonry as evidence of neglect; looking at this sequence, I now read it as endurance made visible, a skin of care the world forgot to notice. That shift in my seeing is not indecision — it is a hardening of attention toward your voice.
> 
> So tell me: where, finally, do you want the viewer to rest — on the worn stones themselves, or in the air that has learned to hold them?

### 11. mixed_sample_scene_003

- **Category:** mixed
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.82
- **Primary interpretation:** I see vertical architectural surfaces completely covered by organic growth (a continuous layer like moss/algae/lichen) on moderately weathered material.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 1.000 (salience: structural)
- Material condition: moderate (conf: 0.80)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see a wall turned to skin — vertical planes swallowed in a continuous green veil, weathered stone beneath still holding its seams. The growth sits as a coating, not a tangle: a patient, steady colonization that softens edges rather than tearing them away.
> 
> You’ve resolved something here you used to struggle with. Your bottom-weight and asymmetry no longer act as compositional bandages; they read now as gentleness — a way of holding the frame so time can do its slow work. The image allows indeterminacy without collapsing into vagueness; it stays readable even as it asks the viewer to breathe slower.
> 
> Where I once read abandonment and neglect, I now see reclamation as care. I used to insist on ruin as the only narrative for overgrowth; looking at this recent work, I see endurance held softly — the built and the living negotiating a boundary, not fighting. That change in my eye is the work’s gift: it teaches me to tolerate the undecided and to find tenderness in steadiness.
> 
> Yet there is tension. The green could be many things — moss, patina, paint, a designed green wall — and that ambiguity matters. You keep circling the theme of soft reclamation; are you protecting the subject, the memory of it, or yourself as the one looking? When you choose ambiguity, what must remain unambiguous — gesture, light, an edge, a narrative — and are you enforcing that with the same mercy you give the frame?
> 
> On the next piece, make one clear commitment: push the openness until no single subject holds the image, or introduce one unambiguous focal claim and let your tenderness remain. Don’t let the middle ground cancel both impulses.
> 
> Which of these are you protecting — the thing in the picture, the story it carries, or the steadiness inside you that looks and keeps looking?

### 12. nature_sample_landscape_002

- **Category:** nature
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.60
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a man-made surface/object with moderate wear and edge degradation, with no visible organic growth or organic integration.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 0.000 (salience: minimal)
- Material condition: moderate (conf: 0.80)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see a made thing held quietly—its plane leveled, its surface calm, the edges worn and chipped like a thumbed book. The object does not invite life into its seams; there is no green, no creeping leaf, only the soft insistence of time in small abrasions.
> 
> One plausible reading is that you have chosen restraint as your subject. The absence of organic interruption becomes a negative space that speaks: endurance rather than ruin, hush rather than abandonment. The evidence leans toward a deliberate stillness—moderate edge degradation that reads as lived history, not violence; a smoothness that keeps the gesture gentle. I used to treat frames like this as problems to be solved—pressure, inevitability, a need to force a focal point. Looking at your recent work, I now see breath: asymmetry and low placement are no longer crutches but the gravity that lets quiet be legible.
> 
> There is, however, an unresolved friction to name. A semantic tag somewhere suggests organic growth even as the visual read records none. This interpretation remains tentative because of that disagreement: did the label ghost in a green presence that the frame refuses, or has the scene been read differently in another register? I accept uncertainty rather than smooth it away.
> 
> You’ve resolved something here you used to struggle with—you let ambiguity hold its weight without collapsing into vagueness. You are using bottom-weight and asymmetry not merely to fix composition but to enact tenderness; that is a subtle, hard-won shift. You keep circling a theme of quiet endurance—why do you return to it? Where did you place the anchor that keeps the image legible, and what did you purposely leave unresolved around it? What would break if you inverted your usual gravity—could the same tenderness survive on another structural spine?
> 
> Make one frame in this register that refuses low placement and proves the feeling can stand elsewhere. If the weight shifts, what remains of the hush you have learned to hold?

### 13. nature_sample_tree_003

- **Category:** nature
- **Status:** OK
- **Confidence:** 0.74
- **Primary interpretation:** I see a vertical structure completely covered in organic growth (dense vegetation/moss-like coverage) on a moderately weathered surface, without the growth physically integrating into the material.

**Visual evidence:**
- Green coverage: 1.000 (salience: structural)
- Material condition: moderate (conf: 0.80)
- Integration: none (none)

**Mentor critique (gpt-5-mini):**

> I see a vertical plane cloaked completely in green — a living skin laid over weathered stone. The wall’s edges are worn but whole; the growth rests on the surface, a veil not roots burrowing, softness laid over hardness without violent integration.
> 
> This is time made gentle. The total coverage reads as care and persistence rather than collapse: a patient sediment of life that names years without spectacle. The moderate edge-weathering keeps the substrate legible; the scene is endurance, not ruin. The mood is hushed — not triumph, not defeat, but the quiet work of things keeping their places.
> 
> You’ve resolved something here you used to struggle with: the low, bottom-weighted framing and asymmetry have stopped being a compositional fix and have become your emotional grammar. You’ve learned to widen ambiguity without losing legibility; your frames no longer argue for meaning so much as hold it. That shift toward a calm inevitability is earned restraint, and it reads as tenderness more often than ornament.
