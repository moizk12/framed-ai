# Next Frontier — Choose ONE

**Only after HITL stabilizes**, pick one direction.

---

## Option A — Perceptual depth

- Better visual primitives: texture coherence, geometry, light logic
- Improve `extract_visual_features` and vision analysis
- Ground FRAMED's reasoning in stronger visual grounding

---

## Option B — Mentor intelligence

- Long-arc guidance: "I've seen you do this before…"
- Leverage user trajectory and pattern memory
- Mentor layer reasons about evolution, not just single images

---

## Option C — Temporal selfhood

- FRAMED narrates its own evolution
- "I used to read these scenes as X. I don't anymore."
- Self-critique and evolution history drive expression

---

**Do not do all three.**
